*# OpenAI API Overview

This project demonstrates the use of OpenAI's APIs for building AI-powered applications. It focuses on three main aspects:

## 1. Chat Completion API
The Chat Completion API allows you to interact with OpenAI's language models to generate conversational responses. It supports maintaining conversation history, enabling context-aware interactions. This is useful for building chatbots or virtual assistants.

## 2. Streaming API
The Streaming API provides real-time responses from the language model. Instead of waiting for the entire response, you can process and display the output incrementally, improving user experience in applications like live chat systems.

## 3. Tool Calling in APIs
The project includes examples of integrating custom tools, such as the `get_weather_function_chat`. These tools allow the API to perform specific tasks, like fetching weather information, based on user queries. This extends the functionality of the language model by combining it with external services or logic.

These components together enable the creation of intelligent, responsive, and feature-rich AI applications.*

## 4. The OpenAI Responses API

 is a new interface designed to simplify the development of AI applications. It offers:

Chat history persistence: Maintain conversation context across interactions.

Tool integrations: Seamlessly incorporate tools like web search, file search, and computer operations.

Enhanced flexibility: Build agentic experiences with improved state management.
